Topic: Evaluation of Textual Feedback for Incorrect Usage of an Augmented Reality Application

Abstract: Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) applications have gained in importance over the years. 
Although they provide a variety of uses, they remain mostly unknown by the public, which results in poor understanding of the controls and features. 
Our research goal is to find out how to react to incorrect mobile AR usage in order to enhance the usability of mobile AR applications. 
For this purpose, we implemented three generic sets of textual feedback for AR applications with different content. 
In order to assess the potential gain in usability provided by these feedback messages, we conducted a case study. 
In this case study, we asked 40 participants to execute a predefined set of tasks and evaluated their errors when using the mobile AR. 
We found that, given appropriate feedback, most people still use incorrect gestures, but quickly recover from mistakes and are much less likely to do them more often.
